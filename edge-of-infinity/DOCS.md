# Edge of Infinity App Documentation

## Sidebar

The app enables Home Assistant Ingress and adds an Edge Infinity item to the sidebar for administrators.

## Logs

Open the app page in Home Assistant and use the Logs tab. Edge Core should write all logs to stdout/stderr so Supervisor can capture them.

## Watchdog

The watchdog checks:

```text
http://[HOST]:[PORT:8088]/health
```

If the app stops answering, Home Assistant Supervisor can mark it unhealthy.

## Public API Port

The `8088/tcp` port is disabled by default. Ingress is preferred.

Enable a public/local host port in the app network settings only if another service needs direct API access.

## Storage

Configuration:

```text
/homeassistant/edge
```

In Home Assistant File Editor this same folder appears as:

```text
/config/edge
```

The add-on keeps `/config` only as an internal/fallback mount for older installs.

Database:

```text
/homeassistant/edge/edge.db
```

Recordings:

```text
/media/edge-of-infinity/recordings
```

Recordings are excluded from normal app backup by default.

## Camera Configuration

On first start, the app creates:

```text
/homeassistant/edge/edge.json
```

This is visible in File Editor as:

```text
/config/edge/edge.json
```

The app also writes a template:

```text
/homeassistant/edge/edge.example.json
```

`edge.example.json` may be refreshed by the app. Your real camera settings belong in `/homeassistant/edge/edge.json`, visible in File Editor as `/config/edge/edge.json`.

The app must not overwrite an existing `edge.json`.

The initial file contains two Hikvision camera slots:

```text
hikvision_1
hikvision_2
```

Edit the IP address, username, password, RTSP URLs, ONVIF URL, and ISAPI base URL for your real cameras. After editing, set:

```json
"enabled": true
```

Restart the app to refresh the current shell panel. The real video engine will use the same file once `edge-core` is bundled.

## RTSP Probe Shell

Starting with version `0.3.0`, the app shell probes enabled cameras with `ffprobe`.

For each camera:

```json
"enabled": true
```

The panel checks `rtsp_main` once when the add-on starts and shows:

- online/offline/disabled status,
- codec,
- resolution,
- FPS value reported by the stream.

Starting with version `0.4.0`, the shell also captures one JPEG snapshot for each online camera. Choose the snapshot source per camera:

```json
"snapshot_stream": "sub"
```

Use `sub` for a lighter panel or `main` for a full-quality snapshot. `rtsp_main` remains the quality probe.

This is not live video yet. It is the first real camera connectivity test before WebRTC live is added. Restart the add-on when you want to rerun the temporary probe.

## Custom Component Auto-Install

Starting with version `0.3.2`, the add-on can install or update the Home Assistant custom component automatically.

The add-on maps the Home Assistant config folder and writes:

```text
/homeassistant/custom_components/edge
```

The option is enabled by default:

```yaml
install_custom_component: true
```

After the add-on updates this folder, restart Home Assistant Core so the integration reloads.
